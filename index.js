/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
    //counter 2 is a simple function that does a single calculation and, once it's run, it's done and there's
      no child element or, for that matter, no parent either. 
    //counter one is two functions in which the child function runs and pushes results to the parent. 
  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?

    //counter 1 uses scope because it combines functions. There's a parent function and a child
      function where the child function reaches out to the parent function for its value/function. 
  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?

  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2

// console.log(finalScore.prototype.concat);   //<---WHY DOESN'T endScore, finalScore NOT HAVE A VALUE YET? I KNOW IT'S TO DO WITH SCOPING BUT NOT SURE WHY THEY'RE STILL UNDEFINED.



//-------------QUESTIONS--------------------
// How can I combine finalScore function with endScore function so that the score for each team is then combined and prints as an object? 

//best way to combine the elements in the new array? Tried array.prototype methods.

//why do I put "9" in my for loop for counting the innings but "3" in my random # generator inning()? for loop starts count at 1 and not 0? 

//how to combine into one function:
  // -receiving the callback for "inningCB," 
  // - receiving the number of innings,
  // - update the score of home and away teams after each inning
  // - return an object after the last inning with final score




/* Task 4: 
// create a function called getInningScore 
// the function should take the inning function as an argument 
// it should return an object with with a score for home and a score for away that that populates from invoking the inning callback. */

function getInningScore() {
  /*Your Code Here */
}
/* Task 5: scoreboard()
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function, that you create, called `getInningScore`
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning (see example below)
  5. If there's a tie, add this message with the score to the end of the array: 
     "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there is no tie, add this message to the end of the array: 
     "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  HINT: `getInningScore` should be invoked by `scoreboard` and use `inning` to get and return the scores back to `scoreboard`
  
  For example: If there is no tie, invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 3",
  "Inning 3: Away 4 - Home 4", 
  "Inning 4: Away 5 - Home 5", 
  "Inning 5: Away 7 - Home 7", 
  "Inning 6: Away 9 - Home 8", 
  "Inning 7: Away 10 - Home 8", 
  "Inning 8: Away 12 - Home 9",
  "Inning 9: Away 13 - Home 11", 
  "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  
]  
  If there is a tie, invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 3",
  "Inning 3: Away 4 - Home 4", 
  "Inning 4: Away 5 - Home 5", 
  "Inning 5: Away 7 - Home 7", 
  "Inning 6: Away 9 - Home 8", 
  "Inning 7: Away 10 - Home 8", 
  "Inning 8: Away 12 - Home 10",
  "Inning 9: Away 12 - Home 12", 
  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"
]
